      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kyle Slaughter. I am 18 years old and a developer. I can do
        front-end and back-end developing but I excel in back-end. I think much
        more logically than I do creatively. I am fluent in c++ and have made
        quite a few interesting projects. You can see them here:
        <a href="#projects">Projects</a>. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and
        relearning javascript. When I first learned how to code, I was using
        javascript, but my college courses had me switch to c++, which is now my
        preferred language. I am fascinated by the engine behind coding,
        basically how the computer interacts with it. I also think AI is really
        cool and I've made my own neural network from scratch in c++.

            <h3>Chess Bot*</h3>
            <p>
              This project is unfinished. It is meant to be a chess bot that a
              user could play against. I was originally using brute force
              methods to find moves to play but after I started creating the
              neural network, I thought it would be better to apply that to my
              bot.

            <h3>Neural Network*</h3>
            <p>
              This project is unfinished. This is the project I'm most proud of.
              I made it in c++ and it uses a class called network that allows
              you to initialize and use a neural network with any amount of
              neurons. I'm very proud of it because I figured it out on my own
              and it was so rewarding when I got it to work. I plan to
              eventually apply it to a connect 4 game and use reinforcement
              learning to teach it.
